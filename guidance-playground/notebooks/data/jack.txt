A last-16 US Open finish and a first ATP Tour final have made 2023 Jack Draper's most successful year of his young career so far. But for the 21-year-old Briton, success has been tinged by sadness with his grandmother Brenda - a former tennis player and coach - unable to recognise his achievements. Draper's grandmother has Alzheimer's disease, a condition that causes dementia and the gradual decline of cognitive functioning in the brain.
