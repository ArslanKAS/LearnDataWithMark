Andy Murray was knocked out of the Miami Open in a dramatic 5-7 7-5 7-6 (7-5) last-32 defeat by Tomas Machac.
The Briton, 36, secured his ninth break point to take a 6-5 lead in the opening set before serving out to love.
But Machac hit back to win the second set and then clinched the match in a third-set tie-break, having previously been broken when serving to progress.
Murray received treatment on an ankle injury late in the third set and was also agitated by movement in the crowd.
Elsewhere, British number one Cameron Norrie lost 7-5 6-1 to third seed Daniil Medvedev in just 81 minutes.
