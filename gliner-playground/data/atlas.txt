In the early 2010s, dynamically typed languages like Python and Javascript, and NoSQL databases like MongoDB and Elasticsearch marked the trend of departing from rigid, upfront schema planning. All of these technologies, with less verbose syntax and greater flexibility, promised quicker development cycles and easier prototyping, making them the languages of choice for startups and new projects aiming for rapid market entry.

However, as projects and organizations grew larger in size and complexity, the initial advantages of these technologies began to reveal significant trade-offs. The lack of schema enforcement led to inconsistencies in data, making it harder to ensure data quality and integrity as applications evolved. The absence of strict type systems and the flexible nature of schema-less databases made debugging and maintaining large codebases increasingly difficult.

The increasing interest in relational storage technology such as ClickHouse signifies a nuanced shift in our industryâ€™s approach to data management. While modern data systems need to process diverse datasets that sometimes require an unstructured approach, there is a growing appreciation for the efficiency and organization that comes with strongly typed, structured data processing methods.
